# Vanilla for Pixel Mover
Just a little project to explore what you can do in web development without any framework.

The goal is a little interactive page. No Framework, library, bundler, ... allowed.

As a side goal I'm exploring different web technologies. But after all this project has no real purpose.

Run this project with

    docker run -p 8080:80 boesi/pixel-mover

## TODOs
- [x] Convert pixel data between boards
- [ ] Click through Highlighters
- [ ] Make PxWindow resizeable
- [ ] Make WalkerController more sophisticated
- [ ] Create a statistic window
- [x] Make Docker image
