# Pixel Mover
Just a little project to explore what you can do in web development without any framework.

The goal is a little interactive page. No Framework, library, bundler, ... is allowed.

As a side goal I'm exploring different web technologies. But after all this project has no real purpose.

## TODOs
- [x] Convert pixel data between boards
- [ ] Click through Highlighters
- [ ] Make PxWindow resizeable
- [ ] Make WalkerController more sophisticated
- [ ] Create a statistic window
